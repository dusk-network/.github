# Reporting Security Vulnerabilities
Dusk Network values the security and integrity of our open-source software libraries and is committed to protecting the assets of our users and partners. As part of our commitment to security, we have established a Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) process to ensure that any potential vulnerabilities in our technology are responsibly and promptly addressed.

If you believe you have discovered a potential vulnerability in any of our software libraries, please follow the guidelines below to report it to us:

1. Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability or exploit it.
2. Fill in the [contact form](https://dusk.network/pages/contact) detailing the vulnerability, including the affected library and version. Include a description of the vulnerability and how to reproduce it.
3. The team will respond within three working days to acknowledge receipt of the report and provide an estimated timeline for resolution.
4. The team will work with the reporter of the vulnerability to ensure that the vulnerability is thoroughly understood, investigated and that a fix is developed.
5. Once a fix has been developed and deployed, the team will notify the reporter, and if applicable, any affected parties.
6. The team will provide a public disclosure of the vulnerability and the steps taken to address it. The reporter and the aligned organization will be thanked and acknowledged for their efforts and contribution. At minimum, this will be done through an `Advisory` published on the public Github, but in certain cases can also lead to the publishing of an article if the organization deems it valuable to do so.

By following this process we can work together to ensure the security and integrity of our open-source libraries and protect the assets of our users and partners. We appreciate your efforts in helping us maintain the security of our technology.
