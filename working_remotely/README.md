# Best Setup For Working Remotely

Dusk Network promotes remote working. In fact, while we started up with an office, we ended up settling for remote working. This guideline contains some important tips to help you making the most out of remote work. We hope it will help you settle in during the first days, especially if you haven’t been working remotely before.

## Your Working Space At Home

**Dedicated**: Clearly distinguish your workspace, take care of good lighting, ergonomic chair and desk.

**Quiet**: You will be speaking a lot with your teammate. If you are in a noisy environment, it is going to make conversations quite challenging. Consider investing in noise-cancelling headphones.

**Good Acoustics**: Avoid working in empty rooms or noisy environments. Flutter echo and reverberation both reduce word intelligibility and create attention fatigue, especially when you are in a confcall. Sometimes simply adding a carpet on the floor and/or curtains, books, or artworks on the walls can greatly improve your room acoustics.

**Stable Internet Connection**: Quite important to make video calls without lagging. Consider a LAN cable.

## Your Working Space At The Virtual Office

In a physical office space, it is normally easy to know who was focused, available, or in a meeting. In summary, people are visible and if you have a problem you walk over to a team, start asking questions and eventually triggering a discussion. **We use Discord to recreate the dynamics**

### How to join the Dusk Virtual Office

Simply click **on the following link**: https://discord.gg/RquvGaJYa2 and let one of the administrators know about it (emanuele@dusk.network or fulvio@dusk.network are safe bets). As soon as you are tagged with the `team` label, you will be up and running in the office.

## Communicating

**Find your way for water cooler conversations**: Take some time every day to simply spend some time with others, join Discord, chat to your team members on Rocket Chat and take part in discussions on different channels/threads.

**Over-communication is fine, advised even**: It’s so much easier to communicate with other people in real life, therefore in a remote setting it’s better to overcommunicate instead of making assumptions and not vocalising things.

**Be ready to take the stage**: From time to time, it is good to prepare a short presentation to introduce the other teammates to your progress and show what your have been working on (and where you might need help if you are stuck).

## Good Practices

**Treat GitHub as to-dos**: If possible, try to structure the issues you are working on so that you can close at least one by the end of your workday. To-do lists are a proven method to stay organised and get a sense of accomplishments at the end of the day.

**Curb distractions**: Avoid distractions like TV, Facebook Newsfeed, Twitter, and other social media.  Limit the usage of non-working related IMs.

**Take regular breaks**: Stand up, walk around, grab a coffee and look out of the window. These healthy habits are happening naturally when working in an office, but it’s easy to forget about them when working at home.

**Wazaap**: Feel free to drop a line in on our `#strip-club` channel dedicated to miscellaneous bullshit and speak your mind. You can discuss about whatever you want, from the many benefits of micro-dosing carrot cakes up to the devilish dancing habits of Trotsky, and everything in between.

**Change your scenery from time to time**: try working from a nice coffee spot or a co-working place. It’s refreshing to break the routine.
