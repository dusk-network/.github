<!-- Short description -->
Dusk is a permissionless, ZK-friendly L1 blockchain protocol focused on Compliance and Privacy to tokenize Real-World Assets.

Our mission is to unlock economic inclusion by bringing institution-level assets to anyone's wallet. Dusk has the only privacy-first technology to bring classic finance and real-world assets on-chain.
