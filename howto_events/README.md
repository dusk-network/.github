# Events

##Conferences

If you eyed an event or a conference you wanna join let us know! If it is deemed beneficial to the organisation, we will pay for your admission fee. If you are a presenter, we will pay also your travel and accommodation. When invited, we tend to go for every event happening in Europe. For other continents, we will consider the importance of the event.

## Meetups

Meetups are awesome, especially those that touch upon technologies that we use or plan to use. Let us know if you are interested in joining a meetup. If logistics does not get too complicated, we will often try and make it a team event. Sometimes, meet-ups are a great opportunity for sponsorships, give talks and promote Dusk Network brand and mission.
