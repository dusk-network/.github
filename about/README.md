# About Dusk Network

## What is Dusk Network

> The power of permissionless smart contracts and the privacy of permissioned ledgers - at the fingertip of any size org

Dusk Network is an open source and secure network infrastructure which hosts a privacy-preserving distributed ledger technology (DLT) used by businesses to tokenize financial instruments and automate costly processes. Dusk is powered by cutting-edge technology engineered from the ground up to ease the inception and deployment of disintermediated services and decentralized applications focusing on the financial sector, both traditional or alternative.  At the core of the network is the first privacy-preserving, distributed consensus protocol that is fast, secure and efficient.‌

### Privacy And Compliance‌

Dusk Network uniquely offers the possibility to automate processes previously requiring the aid of trusted (and costly) third parties. The novel use of [Zero-Knowledge technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) enables organizations to harness the power of DLT while respecting confidentiality agreements, and data protection legislation. Anyone can leverage Dusk Network to inexpensively issue *programmable* financial assets that are governed by privacy preserving smart contracts. 

## Use Cases

Dusk Network is ideal for building transactional applications with high throughput and privacy, that achieve immediate finality without relying on centralized infrastructure or trusted third parties. Organizations have been successfully building applications in different contexts on top of our technology, for example: 

- Automated and self-governing securities.
- Confidential smart contracts and security tokens.
- Digital share registry management.
- Decentralized smart bulletin boards.
- Proxy voting
- Self-custodial applications.
- Decentralized Finance.
