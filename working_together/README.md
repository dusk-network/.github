# Working Together

People at Dusk Network work primarily in a remote fashion. This makes collaboration a bit more challenging. This document should provide some guidelines to overcome the challenges of collaborating when working remotely.

## Team-working Guidelines

### The Overlap

Although everybody can organize the work however they feel more productive, there is a time frame when everybody working must be online.
The team should agree on some timeline where everybody is online. At the moment, there are two timespans during the work week between 10:30-12:30 and then 14.00-17.00 \(GMT+1\). These timespans are called the _Overlap_. The _Overlap_ is of capital importance to make sure that people that experience problems, can get immediate help.

### Communicate Often

ðŸ‘‰ Since [repetita juvant](/README.md#we-are-a-communication-driven-organisation-that-creates-software), Dusk Network is a **communication-driven organisation**. Therefore, the capability of teammates to communicate with each other, both synchronously and asynchronously, is among the most important values of the team's DNA! 

When working on an issue perceived as a blocker, you should turn the communication nob up. The work is higher priority anyway, so have a confcall and report frequently on the IM your progress, your ounces, and questions.

#### Share Phone Numbers

Make sure to share your phone number with the other team members and **don't shy away from calling people directly**.

### Mentions Must Be Answered ASAP During Overlap

When addressed on IM with a mention, please answer as soon as you can. During the _Overlap_ the turnaround should not take more than 5 minutes. If you are encumbered or unavailable for whatever reason, please reply with that and setup a suitable time for a call. 

###Pair Programming

Pair programming is a potent tool to promote knowledge sharing and solve challenges. Therefore, it is highly recommended to practice it often with your teammates. Pair-programming in a remote session is somewhat more demanding focus-wise, therefore it is useful to keep in mind some tips to keep the experience rewarding:

- **Camera on**. No exceptions.
- **Agree on the scope at the beginning of the session**. This helps to keep it focused and concise (Pairing for two hours? Until the ticket is complete? Just get past the bug?)
- **Stick to a pairing style**. Something like [Driver/Passenger? Time-based? Ping pong?](https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html)
- **Keep the chat going**. When in a remote session, the body language unfortunately is very limited and cannot aid the communication. Therefore aim to make up for it with talking more
- **Switch often**. This keeps both parties engaged and prevents zoning out and defocusing.
- **Have frequent breaks**. However, when you do take a break, avoid dropping from the call and keep sharing the screen. It will prevent losing pace.

- **Ask for Feedback before closing the session**. I know it feels weird, but try and do it anyway. Questions like *what did we do well?* And *what could we have done better?* help you improve for next time.

## Priority

We should strive to work in a strict priority order. Also, some items should always be prioritised before the others. From a general perspective, following priority list is always valid:

1. [Blockers](#blockers-and-how-to-deal-with-them)
2. [PR Reviews](#pr-reviews)
3. Other issues     &lt;--- These items are normally the object of planning

### Blockers \(and how to deal with them\)

Some would argue that blockers in software development are more linked to perception, than code. When developing, the whole core of a program is by definition a blocker for the business, whether we are talking about a library, a service, a process or a dependency. Therefore, when we talk about blockers, we actually point to a variety of different root causes, which all have to do with the **perceived incapability of clearing out issues** directly.

If you are working on something, by definition you are not blocked. Therefore, when perceiving blockers, we need to address the incapability of clearing out issues in the parts of the codebase we are not familiar with. 

In order to do that, we need a set of both proactive and reactive measures to avoid blockers \(read: to avoid working on lower priority items, or, worse, fishing for stuff to do\). As usual, many of these measures are directly linked with improving and retaining the quality of communications within the core team.

#### Work Together More

There must be **at least 2 people clearing out a blocker**. Even if there is no way to divide the work, pairing is not possible and they must duplicate their efforts.

#### Break Blockers Down

Blockers are normally perceived as systemic to a whole deliverable. However, this is seldom the case. By breaking down the blocking issue into smaller unit of works, normally a workaround is found to allow other people to keep working on their tasks. In any case, this helps the rest of the team to understand what's going on, and even help out solving the issue at hand.

#### Screen Sharing ASAP

As soon as bumping into a blocker, the developer working on the related issue should get in touch with the teammate most likely to be able to help and organise a [pair programming session](#pair-programming) as soon as reasonably possible to overcome the blocker. 

### PR Reviews

Reviews are higher priority than working on the issues, with the sole exception for blockers. This is to prevent code rotting and other problems. If you are requested to review a PR, you should pause everything else and focus on reviewing that PR first. Please refer to [guidelines for a strong code-review culture](/code_reviews/) for more precise guidelines.

## Meeting Guidelines

We've compiled some guidelines from various sources to help people feel included and respected during meetings. 

- **Be kind:** Treat each other with respect.
- **If there are new members, introduce everyone:** Introductions help break the ice and give an opportunity for voices to be heard.
- **Try to start and end meetings on time**
- **Step up, step back:** After you speak, let others speak. If you are speaking often, make sure others have had a chance to say something.
- **Why am I talking?:** Make sure that the thing you're about to say has not already been said. If it has and has been ignored, clarify that you are amplifying an under-recognized idea.
- **One mic:** Let one person speak at a time, and let them complete their full thought before responding. Don't interrupt.
- **Speak as I:** Don't speak for others.
- **Disagree:** You don't have to agree with everybody, but be aware of how you frame your feedback. Criticize the idea, not the person.
- **Everyone can participate:** Give people the opportunity to decline an invitation.
- **Speak up:** Follow up if team members treat others disrespectfully.
