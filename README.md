# Dusk Network Guidelines

## About This Document 

This document was created for new people joining Dusk Network. We’ve been growing as an organization for quite a while already, and throughout this time we’ve created quite a unique company culture. This set of guidelines focus on the values, philosophy and approach that shape our culture. We hope it will guide you through your first months with us and help with your journey.

This document is a perennial work-in-progress which goal is to provide a quick, and more importantly, unified reference for developing software in the [Dusk Network](/about/) organisation. It is a collection of different guidelines, grouped by topic, which aim to provide aid to developers during the entire process of software development, and create a **positive collective experience** even when facing the hard challenges that litter the journey of developing cutting edge technology.

In general, strive to follow the guidelines with positive criticism. Ask when in doubt, and edit them when appropriate. Use the normal PR and RFC system to amend them.

## Where To Start

This guide will help you get started. **Do not let any of the guidelines intimidate you**. They should be considered a map to help you navigate the process.

### A note on the language

- *Avoid* means don't do something unless you have good reason.
- *Don't* means there's never a good reason to do that thing.
- *Prefer* indicates a better option and its alternative to watch out for.
- *Use* is a positive instruction.

### General guidelines

Following points apply regardless of the technology:

- Don't duplicate the functionality of a built-in library.
- Don't ignore errors and exceptions, or *fail silently*.
- Avoid premature optimisations, especially performance-wise.
- Don't work on performance improvement without a benchmark.
- Avoid scope creeping.
- Keep the code simple.

## We are a communication driven organisation that creates software

Communication should be the number one priority of everyone within Dusk Network. The technology stack we use and maintain is quite complex and extensive. This means that we need to take any chance we are offered to remain up to speed with progress from our teammates, and to share our own knowledge.

Communication extends outside of talking and chatting (which is also something that is VERY encouraged within Dusk Network) through:

- [We are a remote company](/working_remotely/)
- [Working together](/working_together/)
- [Contributing to the codebase](https://github.com/dusk-network/org/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Code Reviews](/code_reviews/)
- [Events](/howto_events/)
