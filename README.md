# Dusk Network Default Health Files

## What is this?

This is the repo that contains the default _Community health files_. According to the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file), health files are default files that help all repositories in the `Dusk Network` organization stay consistent and follow best practices. GitHub will use and display default files for any repository owned by the account that does not have its own file of that type in any of the following places:

- Repository's `root`
- The `.github` folder
- The `docs` folder

## Changing these templates

It is possible to change any of the health files through the normal process of opening an [issue](/../../issues), submitting a [Pull Request](/../../pulls) for review, and merging it on the `main` branch when approved by the reviewers
